# [Scala Days Chicago](http://event.scaladays.org/scaladays-chicago-2017)

The Scala Center is organizing an *Open Source Spree* at Scala Days, on Tuesday, April 18.

The focus of Scala Sprees are to introduce newcomers to open source! Come learn how to 
contribute to open source Scala projects. Meet other contributors on well-known open 
source Scala projects.

**Your challenge?** Get one pull request merged into one of the represented Scala projects,
and get this awesome t-shirt:
